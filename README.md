A minimalist, static admin dashboard designed for task management, inspired by the layouts of Kanban boards and Jira. This project was developed as a focused exercise to master **CSS Grid** layouts.

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

The primary objective of this project was to practice and implement advanced **CSS Grid** techniques. It explores how to structure complex dashboard interfaces—featuring sidebars, headers, and multi-column content areas—using a grid-first approach rather than traditional floats or heavy flexbox nesting.

## 🚀 Features

* **Task Management UI:** A clean interface designed for organizing and managing daily tasks.
* **Grid-Based Layout:** Entirely structured using CSS Grid for precise alignment and positioning.
* **Minimalist Design:** A focused, "distraction-free" aesthetic for better productivity visualization.
* **Pure Styles:** Built without the use of external frameworks or libraries.

## 🛠️ Built With

* **HTML5:** Semantic markup for the dashboard structure.
* **CSS3:** Utilizing CSS Grid as the core layout engine.
* **No JavaScript:** This is a static UI demonstration; no functional logic or interactivity has been added.

## ⚠️ Important Notes

* **Not Responsive:** This project was built to practice specific grid alignments on desktop views (1440px width recommended) and is not currently optimized for mobile devices.
* **Static UI:** As there is no JavaScript, the "Add Task" or "Search" functions are visual only.
